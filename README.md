# Hackerrank 30 days of code


INTRODUCTION:
      Coding is a basic literacy in the digital age, and it is important for kids to understand and be able to work with and understand the technology around them. Having children learn coding at a young age prepares them for the future. Coding helps children with communication, creativity, math,writing, and confidence.
      Coding is the ability to design, write, test, implement and maintain a computer programmeâ€™s source code. This code is written in a programming language, with its own syntax and meanings. In order to be able to code, you need to understand this language, and understand the way it works.

It can be tricky to learn, as it is tricky to learn any language, and programming languages are exacting as a simple mistake can have significant effects on performance or functionality. But some languages are easier to learn than others; often recommended first languages include C, Java, Ruby and Python. These languages are syntactically very similar, though they are used for different kinds of application.



30 DAYS OF CODE BY HACKERRANK:
          HackerRank is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.
          Hackerrack is a popular coding platform that helps coding enthusiasts to take part in variuos coding contests and practice coding problems in several languages based on difficulty levels. 30 days of code is a programme that is started by hackerrank to influence the coding enviornment of today's world. You would get a question each day for 30 days solving which would help your coding improve by certain levels.          



AIM OF THIS REPOSITORY:
          This is a repository aiming to provide solutions to the 30 days code challenge (2020) conducted by hackerrank. 
The solutions are available in major languages like c++, python and javascript as of now. It is a great platform
